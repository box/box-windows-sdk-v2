    /// server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive
    /// updated responses.

    /// Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for
    /// enterprise events.
    /// 
    /// To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll
    /// URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.
    /// 
    /// When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value
    /// `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as
    /// it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a
    /// request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known
    /// `stream_position`.

    /// After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now
    /// repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.
    /// 
    /// If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will
    /// receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response
    /// youâ€™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.
    /// 
    /// If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to
    /// make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response
    /// for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.
    /// 
    /// Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the
    /// real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint
