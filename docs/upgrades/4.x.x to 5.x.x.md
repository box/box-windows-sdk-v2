### Minimal .NET runtime version upgrade

If you are still using .NET Framework version lower than 4.6.2 you need to upgrade to the 4.6.2+ version. You can do it by changing target framework in the .csproj file of your project.

For SDK-style projects

Before
```xml
<TargetFramework>net45<TargetFramework/>
```

After
```xml
<TargetFramework>net462<TargetFramework/>
```

See [SDK-style target framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks) for more information.

For non SDK-style projects

Before
```xml
<TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
```

After
```xml
<TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.6.2</TargetFrameworkVersion>
```

See [MSBuild target framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-target-framework-and-target-platform?view=vs-2022) for more information

We recommend to upgrade to the newest version possible.
